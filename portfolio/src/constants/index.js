export const ABOUT_TEXT = `My web development journey started with a curiosity for technology, growing up in Nepal and experimenting with tools like the inspect element in my browser. This passion grew when I moved to the U.S. and began pursuing computer science at CU Boulder. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy tackling complex challenges to come up with high quality solutions. Outside of coding, I stay active through hiking, snowboarding, and roadtripping, and Iâ€™m passionate about contributing to open source projects whenever I can. I also like to paint and watch animes as a hobby!`;
